    <h1 style="aqua: red;">The dog is a domesticated descendant of 
      the gray wolf.</h1> 
      <p style="color: rgb(106, 0, 255);">Also called the domestic dog, 
        it was selectively bred from a
         population of wolves during the Late 
         Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was 
         the first species to be domesticated by humans, 
         over 
        14,000 years ago and before the development of
         agriculture.</p>
